Our project the converter app is an all in one solution for all file conversions.

It is a versatile ,on the go system application that allows the end users to use it with ease.The user-friendly app makes sure all the files including the gif and jpg to be converted to their respective required types.This is especially handy since users work with files that are not compatible with the different programs  and is needed to be able to convert any file or files using the user friendly gui menu.
